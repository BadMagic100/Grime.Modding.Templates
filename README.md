Templates for modding Grime. Usage:

```
> dotnet new install Grime.Modding.Templates

> dotnet new grimeplugin -n YourModName
```

Use `dotnet new grimeplugin --help` to see additional options. For the mod to work you will have to set up
BepInEx first. GRIME requires some special help in order for BepInEx to function. All of the necessary software
is available in the [BadMagic100/Grime.ModdingTools](https://github.com/BadMagic100/Grime.ModdingTools) repo.
